I am a joint Ph.D. candidate at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS) and the City University of Hong Kong (CityU). I earned my bachelor's degree from the Central University of Finance and Economics (CUFE) in 2021. My research interests encompass Graph Data Mining, AI4Science, and Risk Analysis.
